Bae:
Tension between different segments of the public that want or don't want the controversial decision.
Put more description about the meaning of the parameters.
Untangling ideology vs institutionalism.
Commonality with Sara's argument.

Jeff Staton:
Communication between judges
Temporal changes, longterm thinking
What does it mean to reduce their ability to enact policy
- Does it mean the content of the decision itself ties their hand?
  For example,
- Decision affects the electoral hopes
  Is this really a problem?
  If you have a strong enough majority to enact the controversial decision,
  you can just slap down anything the non-copartisans enact
- Affect the court itself via (e.g.) court packing
  Super serious problem, but a much more remote possibility

Dan:
Should the precision be at the issue level rather than the judge level
    Court would be most risk accepting on the issues with the biggest cost

Think about risk acceptance and people
