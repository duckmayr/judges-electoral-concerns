# Introduction

Some popular accounts of the US Supreme Court's decisions in *NFIB v. Sebelius* and *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* paint Chief Justice John Roberts as an ardent institutionalist, seeking a middle way to protect the Court's legitimacy; but what if there was another dynamic at play?
A strand of the judicial politics literature argues that politicians may offload the responsibility for pulling the trigger on controversial policies to the courts, either because they do not have the leeway to enact their preferred policies or to avoid electoral consequences [CITE CITE CITE].
Generally, in these analyses, the courts are treated as only considering the *direct* policy ramifications of their decisions.
I take a new approach and consider that judges might take into account the policies that politicians will be able to pass in the periods following a controversial decision by the courts... as we've seen with the aftermath of the *Dobbs* decision, such cases can have an impact on citizens' voting intentions [CITE].

# The Model

The problem I am focusing on is a multimember court faced with an opportunity to adopt a controversial policy that a majority of its members want to adopt, and I restrict my attention to the bargaining problem among that majority.
That is, they must determine how far they are willing to go given the controversial nature of the policy; do they fully implement the controversial policy and risk electoral backlash against their ideological allies in the government, or do they avoid adopting it for fear of electoral backlash?
Or perhaps do they take a half-measure, balancing their desire to implement this policy and their concern for the policies in the legislature's domain in the next period?

So, I consider a set $J$ of the judges of the potential majority coalition to enact this policy; each judge $i$'s preferences can be represented by the following utility function:

\begin{equation}
U_i(p; \alpha_i, \beta_i)
= p\alpha_i + \left( 1 - p^2 \right)\beta_i.
\end{equation}

Here $p \in [0, 1]$ represents the extent to which the court's opinion adopts the controversial policy and $\alpha_i > 0$ is the value of the policy to judge $i$, so that $p\alpha_i$ represents the policy gain from a choice of $p$ from $i$'s perspective.
However, $i$ also cares about the policies that will be enacted by the government in the next period.
Normalizing the value of the platform of $i$'s political opponents to $0$, $\beta_i$ represents the expected benefit of legislative policy in the next period---that is, the value of the platform of $i$'s copartisans weighted by the *a priori* probability that they are elected into government.
Then $p^2$ represents the electoral penalty against $i$'s copartisans for a particular choice of $p$.

The choice of $p$ that maximizes each judge's utility is $\alpha_i / (2\beta_i)$.
However, a judge cannot unilaterally set $p$.
Suppose one of the judges, who we will label $a$, has proposal power; that is, they announce a value of $p$ that the court's opinion will set and the other judges choose whether or not to sign on to the opinion.
A judge's utility if there is no majority for setting $p \neq 0$ is the utility of setting $p = 0$, or $\beta_i$; therefore, they would be willing to sign on to any opinion setting $p$ at a value for which $u_i(p) \geq \beta_i$, or $p \in [0, \alpha_i / \beta_i]$.
So a majority coalition can support an opinion establishing any $p$ that is in the interval $\bigcap_i\, [0, \alpha_i / \beta_i]$.
If that intersection is nonempty, the proposing judge chooses the $p$ from that interval that is closest to $\alpha_a / (2\beta_a)$.

The first useful result is

::: {.proposition}

The maximum value of $p$ that a judge $i$ would accept is increasing in $\alpha_i$ and decreasing in $\beta_i$.

:::

This is readily apparent from the judges' acceptance regions, but its meaning is important.
When a judge is unwilling to sign on to adoption of a controversial policy, they are often portrayed as more moderate than their colleagues who are willing to do so.
However, $\beta_i$, which represents the value to judge $i$ of the policy gains their copartisans in the legislature could bring to the table, is also a measure of judge $i$'s ideological extremity.
As $\beta_i$ increases, the judge puts more value on their copartisans being able to enact a very conservative/liberal legislative agenda, which puts pressure on the judge not to endanger these legislative policy gains.
So contrary to popular narratives, a judge being unwilling to sign on to adoption of a controversial policy may be precisely because they **are** ideologically extreme overall.
Judges are simply more willing to adopt controversial policies when they are specifically ideologically extreme with respect to the single issue the controversial policy pertains to, and perhaps may even be more moderate overall than abstainers.
